#### Option B: Using Git Command Line

```bash
# Clone the repository (replace with your username and repo name)
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/member-matcher.git
cd member-matcher

# Copy your files into the folder
# (copy index.html, styles.css, script.js, README.md, .gitignore)

git commit -m "Initial commit - Member Matcher app"
git push origin main
```

### Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages

### Custom Domain (Optional)

If you want a custom domain:
